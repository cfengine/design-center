# The CFEngine Design Center

**Please note: you need [CFEngine 3.4.0](http://cfengine.com/community/3.4.0) or later to use the Design Center tools and sketches.**
  
Welcome to the CFEngine Design Center, a place for CFEngine community
members and developers to share code and information.

To get started, please read the documentation [on the CFEngine website](https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/manuals-design-center.html).

The [reference documentation](https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/reference-design-center.html) will also be helpful.

The official page of the Design Center is at <http://cfengine.com/cfengine-design-center>

On April 10th, 2013 a new version of the Design Center framework and tools was
released, which includes a new backend API that dramatically improves
performance and capabilities, while making sketches much easier to write and
more powerful. Some documentation might be outdated for a bit while we catch up
in updating it. For a description of the API, please see
[its documentation](https://github.com/tzz/design-center/blob/feature/api/howto/dc_api.md).

If you have any feedback, we would love to hear from you, send us a message to <design-center@cfengine.com>.
