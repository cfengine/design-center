# The CFEngine Design Center

**Please note: you need [CFEngine 3.6.0](http://cfengine.com) or later to use the Design Center tools and sketches.**
  
Welcome to the CFEngine Design Center, a place for CFEngine community
members and developers to share code and information.

To get started, please read the documentation [on the CFEngine website](https://cfengine.com/docs/master/manuals-design-center.html).

The [reference documentation](https://cfengine.com/docs/master/reference-design-center.html) will also be helpful.

The official page of the Design Center is at <http://cfengine.com/cfengine-design-center>

The Design Center framework and tools includes a backend API that dramatically
improves performance and capabilities, while making sketches much easier to
write and more powerful. For a description of the API, please see
[its documentation](https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/blob/master/howto/dc_api.md).

If you have any feedback, we would love to hear from you, send us a message to <design-center@cfengine.com>.
