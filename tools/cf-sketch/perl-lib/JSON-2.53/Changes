Revision history for Perl extension JSON.

## JSON version 2.xx #####################################################

In this version, JSON was totally rewritten.

  * JSON becomes a wrapper to JSON::XS or JSON::PP!
  * objToJson() and jsonToObj() are obsoleted!
  * $JSON::* variables are no longer available!
  * JSON::Parser and JSON::Converter are deleted from the distribution!
  * JSONRPC* and Apache::JSONRPC are deleted from the distribution!
     Please check JSON::RPC (supports JSON-RPC protocol v1.1 and 1.0).

##########################################################################

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSON::PP was inculded in JSON distribution (CPAN module).
It comes to be a perl core module in Perl 5.14.
And JSON::PP well be split away it.

JSON distribution will inculde yet another JSON::PP modules.
They are JSNO::backportPP. So JSON.pm should work as it did at all!

	- decode() always utf8::decode()ed to strings.
	- decode() returned a big integer as string though the integer is
          smaller than it is so.
	- a bad know how - added the join() wrapper for Perl 5.8.0 - 5.8.2 bug.
