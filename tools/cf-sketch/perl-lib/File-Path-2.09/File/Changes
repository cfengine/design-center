2.07_03 2009-06-21 13:11:30 UTC
    - Merged 2.07_02 patches from blead
    - Remove stat checks on Windows platform (inhibits 
      UNC path removals from working, and Windows is
      immune to this particular attack). CPAN #34701

2.07 2008-11-09 13:05:50 UTC
    - Another VMS test tweak from Craig and additional
      improvements from Gisle.

    - More documentation tweaks from Gisle Aas.
    - VMS tweaks courtesy of Craig A. Berry (cpan #40512).

2.06_07 2008-10-29 14:20:16 UTC
    - Silence 'uninitialized warning' reported in #36615.
    - Fix $Force_Writeable issue reported in #36982 (see also
      http://bugs.debian.org/487319).
    - Code style improvements and documentation improvements
      from Gisle Aas.

2.06_06 2008-10-05 21:55:34 UTC
    - Documentation improvements, no code changes.

2.06_05 2008-10-02 20:30:17 UTC
    - Introduce make_path() and rm_tree() API extension.
    - Remove problematic test revealed by Matt Kraal on QNX
      (see http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/140187)

2.06_04 2008-05-13 14:28:10 UTC
    - Can't use \S+ if a directory name contains a space (which
      it will may do on Windows (the continuing saga of CPAN #35708)).

2.06_03 2008-05-12 20:17:33 UTC
    - ancestor removal test getting slashed up on Windows
      (see CPAN #35708).

2.06_02 2008-05-12 09:53:39 UTC
    - Problem on Windows where c:\path\to\dir was not considered
      to be underneath C:/Path/To (issues of directory separators
      and case sensitivity). As reported in smoke report
      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1435813.html

2.06_01 2008-05-10 20:54:35 UTC
    - Close directory handle in t/Path.t with closedir (close is
      close but incorrect). Problem identified with Strawberry
      Perl.

2.06 2008-05-08 09:27:24 UTC
    - skip counts for ancestor rmpath() tests were wrong
    - fix old/new interface heuristics as per Gisle Aas
      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/05/msg136625.html

2.05 2008-05-07 08:20:20 UTC
    - better diagnosics and less panicking when
      removing an ancestor path. Reported by Alan Ferrency
      and patch suggested by Michael Schilli (#31721).
    - fix typo spotted by Brendan O'Dea (#35623).

2.04 2007-11-22 13:43:34 UTC
    - integrate blead change #32276 (rmtree a file on VMS)
      (see http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.changes/2007/11/msg20108.html)
    - add a test to show that we can rmtree() a file
    - specify core prereqs in Makefile.PL (as per cpants)

2.03 2007-11-04 18:11:51 UTC
    - On 5.8.x, the installation would be shadowed by the core
      files, and thus not be visible. Makefile.PL tweaked
      appropriately to ensure that the installation overwrites
      the core files. Users on 5.6 and below need not upgrade,
      users on 5.8 should. Bug spotted by imacat (#30459).
    - Minor changes to the way POD tests are initialised.

2.02 2007-10-24 10:05:30 UTC
    - documentation correction fix only: corrected name of module
      File::Find::Rule. Users need not upgrade.

2.01 2007-09-29 10:16:34 UTC
    - the documentation referred to 'skip_others', but the attribute
      is named 'safe'.
    - correctly test VMS behaviour when safe attribute is set.

2.00_11 2007-09-08 12:51:30 UTC
    - depth attribute (for keep_root functiionality) was not
      correctly initialised in both old and new APIs
    - initial chdir() into a child dir would fail on strange
      protection masks (following race condition fix).
    - delete subsequent root paths even if a previous one fails

2.00_10 2007-09-04 17:18:01 UTC
    - Infinite loop fix in _rmtree() for VMS (perl change #31775)
    - Documentation improvements

2.00_09 2007-08-20 18:08:31 UTC
    - Fixed up a few oddments in the race prevention code
    - Reworded/reworked the diagnostics

2.00_08 2007-08-01 00:04:35 UTC
    - Fix race condition in rmtree() as inspired by
      http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79685

2.00_07 2007-07-09 19:33:52 UTC
    - 2.00_06 upload unfortunately contained blib directories

2.00_06 2007-07-04 21:34:14 UTC
    - Incorporate code changes from blead
    - Skip counts off by one

2.00_05 2007-06-27 21:23:25 UTC
    - Use catfile() instead of catdir() in _mkpath() for VMS,
      patch from Craig Berry.
    - Don't use warnings (my code doesn't have errors anyway),
      code change suggested by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.
    - Don't pass LICENSE key to WriteMakefile in Makefile.PL
      if the installed version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not
      sufficiently modern.

1.99_02 2007-05-27 09:25:53 UTC
    - Don't allow a directory named '' (empty string) to be created.
    - File::Spec routines catdir() and updir() interact differently on Win32
    - $! needs to be managed more carefully on Win32

1.99_01 2007-05-17 13:09:59 UTC
    - Dual-lifed from the Perl core distribution.
    - New-style interface added.
    - Extensive tests added to improve code coverage.
    - 5.005 compatibility restored
