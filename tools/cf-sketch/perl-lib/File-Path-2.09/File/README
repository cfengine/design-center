This file is the README for File::Path version 2.09

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

TESTING

This module requires the following modules for thorough testing:

  (These are core, you should be ok)
  Cwd
  File::Path
  File::Spec::Functions
  Test::More

  (These are optional)
  Test::Output
  Test::Pod
  Test::Pod::Coverage

For more advanced testing, it is possible to run the
eg/setup-extra-tests program as root. This will create a
directory 'EXTRA' that contains a mixture of files and
directories owned both by root and a specified user
(uid or login name).

  sudo perl eg/setup-extra-tests -u david
  make test

This is used to exercise parts of the code that ordinarily
wouldn't be visited. That is, as root, some files and
directories will be created that the user 'david', which
will run the test suite, will not be able to remove.

It would be nice to do something tricksy like this for
Win32, which has a much richer privilege scheme.
