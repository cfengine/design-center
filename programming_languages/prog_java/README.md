PLATFORMS:
 LINUX (Redhat, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE)

DESCRIPTION:
 This blueprint contains a bundle to install JRE packages either from OPENJDK or SUN/ORACLE. The current version is "6u30". You may need to modify the bundle to upgrade JRE version.

REQUIREMENTS:
 * CFEngine version 3.x.x
 * Public/Private software repository
 * CFEngine standard library (cfengine_stdlib.cf)

INSTALLATION:
 Save "prog_java.cf" as "/var/cfengine/masterfiles/blueprints/programming_languages/prog_java.cf" in the policy hub.

SAMPLE USAGE:
 body common control
 {
  bundlesequence => { prog_java("$(type)","$(state)") };
          inputs => {
                     "cfengine_stdlib.cf",
                     "blueprints/programming_languages/prog_java.cf", 
                    };
 }

 or call the bundle up by methods: promise

 body common control
 {
  bundlesequence => { "main" };
          inputs => {
                     "cfengine_stdlib.cf",
                     "blueprints/programming_languages/prog_java.cf", 
                    };
 }

 bundle agent main
 {
  methods:
   any::
    "JRE" usebundle => prog_java("$(type)","$(state)");
 }

 This bundle accepts only 3 values of $(type) parameter and 2 values of $(state) parameter.

 $(type) = "openjdk"
  To select JRE from OPENJDK

 $(type) = "sun"
  To select JRE from SUN/Oracle

 $(type) = "oracle"
  To select JRE from SUN/Oracle

 $(state) = "on"
  To install JRE 

 $(state) = "purge"
  To uninstall JRE
