Declarative vs. Imperative Programming
--------------------------------------

(By Mike English)

to newcomers, even if they are experienced programmers in
other domains. Most commonly-used programming languages
are examples of imperative programming, in which the
programmer must describe a specific algorithm or process.
Declarative programming instead focuses on describing
the particular state or goal be be achieved.
