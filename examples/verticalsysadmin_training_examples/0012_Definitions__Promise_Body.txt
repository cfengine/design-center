Definitions: Promise Body
-------------------------

A promise body* is a collection of promise attributes that details
and constrains the nature of the promise.

*Think "body" as in the body of a letter, or the body of a contract - it's
where the details are.

The Macmillan Dictionary defines "body" as: the main part of a book
or document, not including the introduction, notes, or appendices
(=parts added at the end).
