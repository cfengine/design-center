Software Components


CFEngine 3 consists of a number of components:

* cf-promises 

  You can use it to syntax check your policies:

    cf-promises -f ./your_policy.cf


* cf-agent

Execute your policies.  cf-agent is responsible
for maintaining promises about the state of your
system.  It's the part of cfengine that actually
makes changes to the system. 


   cf-agent -f ./your_policy.cf
