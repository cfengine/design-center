Wipe the slate clean (on both client and server):

   rpm -e cfengine-community
   rm -rf /var/cfengine/

   rpm -i cfengine*rpm


On the server:

Edit /var/cfengine/masterfiles/def.cf to add client and
server IPs to the "acl" list.

On the server, configure the firewall to allow access on 
cfengine port 5308:

    /etc/init.d/iptables stop
    chkconfig iptables off  # for training only, not production!!

Install CFEngine RPM on the client.

On the server:

  cf-agent --bootstrap -s 10.1.1.10  
  cf-agent -f update.cf -IK

On the client:  

  cf-agent --bootstrap -s 10.1.1.10  
  cf-agent -f update.cf -IK
