Set a custom class based on the existance of a file.  For example:

[source,cfengine3,numbered]
-----
    classes:

       "file_exists"

           expression  =>  fileexists("/etc/site_id") ;
-----

Then write another promise that is conditional on the above class.

Run it when the file exists, and when it does not, and observe how CFEngine dynamically configures your server.
