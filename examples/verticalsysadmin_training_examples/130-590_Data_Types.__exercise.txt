EXERCISES

1. Create a list containing names of five files
   to create (for example:

      /tmp/file1
      /tmp/file2
      /tmp/file3
      /tmp/file4
      /tmp/file5

   Then use a single "files" promise to ensure all
   five files exist.


2. Create a list containing names of processes that
   should not be running: for example "trn" and "eggdrop"

   Use a single "processes" promise to ensure these
   processes are not running.

If you finish before the rest of the class, please
study chapters 1 - 4 in the Reference Manual.
