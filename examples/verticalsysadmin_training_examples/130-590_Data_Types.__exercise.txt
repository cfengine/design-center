EXERCISES

1. Create a list variable containing names of five files
   to create.  For example:

      /tmp/file1
      /tmp/file2
      /tmp/file3
      /tmp/file4
      /tmp/file5

   Then use a single "files" promise to ensure all
   five files exist.
   
1b. For advanced students, add a report if any of 
    the files are over 10 bytes in size.

2. Create a list containing names of processes that
   should not be running: for example "trn" and "eggdrop"

   Use a single "processes" promise to ensure these
   processes are not running.

If you finish before the rest of the class, please
study your red CFEngine book.
