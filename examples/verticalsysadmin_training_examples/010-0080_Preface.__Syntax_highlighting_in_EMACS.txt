Using the Emacs syntax highlighter
----------------------------------

1. Get latest stable Emacs (Emacs 24.1.2)

2. Remove the cfengine syntax highlighter rules files that
   ship with Emacs 24.1.2 as this cfengine.el is out of date
   compared to the one on in the CFEngine repository:

    rm share/emacs/24.1/lisp/progmodes/cfengine.elc
    rm share/emacs/24.1/lisp/progmodes/cfengine.el.gz

3. Install "cfengine.el" from 
   https://raw.github.com/cfengine/core/master/contrib/cfengine.el
   to the progmodes directory from #2 above.

4. Open a .cf file: `C-x C-f FILENAME.cf'

5. Explicitly activate the mode" `M-x cfengine3-mode'
   (M-x is Alt-x or Esc-x usually)

6. If you want to always activate cfengine3-mode when you open
   files that end in .cf, add to following to ~/.emacs:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist ("\\.cf\\'" . cfengine3-mode))

7. In 24.2 cfengine-mode will be aliased to cfengine3-mode, but for
   now it's aliased to cfengine-auto-mode, which tries to figure out if
   you're using 2 or 3 and defaults to 2.
