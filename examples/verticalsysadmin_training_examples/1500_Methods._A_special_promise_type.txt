There is a special promise type in CFEngine 3 called "methods"
that promises to call another promise bundle.  


 methods:

        "any"

           usebundle => bundle_name("parameter", ...);


The promiser can be any word, right now it does not matter;
the promiser is reserved for future development.  Parameters
are optional.
