                   EXERCISE

Running CFEngine Non-Interactive (as a Service)
using promises.cf as input.

1. Put your "motd" exercise file under
   /var/cfengine/masterfiles/services/

2. Edit /var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf:
   - Add your "motd" exercise file name to "inputs" list
   - Add your "motd" exercise bundle name to "bundlesequence" list

3. Now let's test it:

    > /etc/motd               # make a repair necessary
    cf-agent -f update.cf -I  # update from "masterfiles" to "inputs"
    cf-agent -I               # make sure /etc/motd is repaired


4. Remove your /etc/motd and watch CFEngine create
   /etc/motd within 5 minutes:

     watch ls -l /etc/motd 2>/dev/null
------------------------------------------------------------------
Change cf-execd schedule from 5 min to 1 min. 
1. in /var/cfengine/masterfiles/controls/cf_execd.cf, set
     schedule => { "any" }; 
cf-agent -f update.cf -I
/etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart
