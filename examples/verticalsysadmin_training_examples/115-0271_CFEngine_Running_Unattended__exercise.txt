                   EXERCISE

Running CFEngine Non-Interactive (as a Service)
using /var/cfengine/inputs/promises.cf as input.

1. Specify a bundlesequence in your policy from exercise 5
(that creates an /etc/motd file that always says Unauth.
Use Forbidden, and "go home, it's the weekend" on the weekend.
Add to this policy:

   body common control {

        bundlesequence =>  { "..." };

                       }

2. Copy this modified exercise 5 to /var/cfengine/inputs/promises.cf
3. Make your failsafe.cf identical to promises.cf:
      cd /var/cfengine/inputs
      ln -s promises.cf failsafe.cf
4. Check the syntax of the default input file (promises.cf):
      cf-promises
5. Run CFengine from command line once to make sure it all works:
      cf-agent
6. Restart CFEngine service to reload the policy:
      /etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart
7. Make sure you don't have an /etc/motd file so CFEngine has something to fix: 
     rm /etc/motd
8. Watch CFEngine create /etc/motd within 5 minutes:
     watch ls -l /etc/motd 2>/dev/null
