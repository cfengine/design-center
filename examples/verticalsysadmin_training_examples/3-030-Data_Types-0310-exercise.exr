Create a list variable containing names of five files to create.  For example:

      /tmp/file1
      /tmp/file2
      /tmp/file3
      /tmp/file4
      /tmp/file5

   Then use a single "files" promise to ensure all five files exist.
   
*For advanced students, add a report if any of the files are over 10 bytes in size.
