Arrays are associative.  They may contain scalars
or lists as their elements.

Array variables are written with '[' and ']' brackets:

$(array_name[key_name])

or

$(bundle_name.array_name[key_name])


Example: 


Food Prices
-----------

Apple   59c
Banana  30c
Oranges 35c

vars:   "food_prices[Apple]"    string =>  "59c";

$(food_prices[Apple])
