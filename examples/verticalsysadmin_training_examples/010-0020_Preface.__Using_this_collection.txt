Using this collection
=====================

The examples are arranged in order.

You can study them in sequence, or just look at the
examples that interest you (or find examples of 
particular functions/attributes with /bin/grep).

To study the examples in sequence, you can list
them with "ls -1" or with provided "l.sh" script
(which colorizes the file names and inserts chapter
breaks to make the listing easier to read).
