EXERCISE

1. Use CFEngine to make /tmp/mirror contain
a copy of /usr/local/sbin

(Hint: use a files promise with a copy_from attribute)

2. Now create a new file in /usr/local/sbin
and confirm CFEngine will copy it over.

3. Work out how to mirror file removals.
(When a file is removed in /usr/local/sbin,
it should disappear in /tmp/mirror.)
