Scope of variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: a fully qualified variable consists of the bundle 
name wherein the variable is defined plus the variable 
name.  Example: 

    bundle agent mybundle { vars: "myvar" string => "myvalue"; }

$(myvar)   <--- unqualified

$(mybundle.myvar)  <--- fully qualified (complete with scope)
