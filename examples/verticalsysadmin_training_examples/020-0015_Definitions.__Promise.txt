Definition: Promise
-------------------

The CFEngine software manages every intended system outcome as "promises" to
be kept. A CFEngine Promise corresponds roughly to a rule in other software
products, but importantly promises are always things that can be kept and
repaired continuously, on a real time basis, not just once at install-time.
