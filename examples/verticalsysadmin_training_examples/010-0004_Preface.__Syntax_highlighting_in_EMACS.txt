Using the emacs syntax highlighter
----------------------------------

1) Get latest stable Emacs (Emacs 24.1.2)

2) Remove the cfengine syntax highlighter rules files that ship with Emacs 24.1.2 (this cfengine.el is out of date) compared to the one on in the CFEngine repository:

 share/emacs/24.1/lisp/progmodes/cfengine.elc
 share/emacs/24.1/lisp/progmodes/cfengine.el.gz

3) Replace it by installing the "cfengine.el" file from 
https://raw.github.com/cfengine/core/master/contrib/cfengine.el
to the progmodes directory from #2 above.

2) Open a .cf file `C-x C-f FILENAME.cf'

3) Explicitly activate the mode `M-x cfengine3-mode' (M-x is Alt-x or
   Esc-x usually)

4) If you want it to always happen, add this to ~/.emacs:

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.cf\\'" . cfengine3-mode))

5) In 24.2 cfengine-mode will be aliased to cfengine3-mode, but for
   now it's aliased to cfengine-auto-mode, which tries to figure out if
   you're using 2 or 3 and defaults to 2.
