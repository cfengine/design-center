Example of dynamic inputs and bundlesequence
based on Neil Watson's blog post
http://watson-wilson.ca/2011/09/dynamic-bundlesequence-in-cfengine.html

The purpose is: you have lots of inputs files
containing lots of bundles -- to increase efficiency
and reduce resource usage, we only read in the those
inputs files that we need (as determined by classes),
and only run those bundles we need.
