Robin Dunbar pointed out that there are limits to human cognition:
- We can only have a close relationship to about 5 things.
- We can have a working relationship with about 30 things or people.
- We can only be acquainted with about 150.

The `Dunbar numbers' are cognitive limits that we have to work around.
