Purpose: practice editing file content using a template containing scalar variables.

. Manually create a template containing:

-----
Hello $(example.first_name),

  Please buy our product.

Love,
Company
-----


. Populate contents of '/tmp/letter.txt' using the above template and the variable "first_name" defined in a bundle "example".

Gotchas:

- Make sure your bundle name matches the bundle name in the variable in the template.

- Make sure your bundle defines the variable embedded in the template.

If you finish before rest of the group, finish studying the CFEngine Reference Manual chapters 1 -4, and if you finish that, then study the Special Topic guide on Editing File Content.
