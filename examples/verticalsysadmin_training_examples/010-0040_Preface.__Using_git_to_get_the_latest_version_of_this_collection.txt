Using git to download the latest version of these examples
==========================================================

1. Download Aleksey's fork of the CFEngine Design Center (which
   is where Aleksey commits the latest versions of the examples
   collection, and then sends a pull request to the cfengine
   Design Center repo on github)

    git clone git://github.com/atsaloli/design-center.git atsaloli-design-center

2. Go to the Training Examples:

    cd atsaloli-design-center/examples/verticalsysadmin_training_examples	

3. If Aleksey adds examples during class, you can sync from Aleksey's repo:

    git pull origin
