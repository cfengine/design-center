EXERCISE

Practice using "methods" type promises

Write a policy that has two bundles.

The first bundle does something visible (such as a
reports type promise that says "bundle1") AND calls
the second bundle.

The second bundle reports "bundle2".

Run your policy?  What output do you see and in what
order?  Why?


EXERCISE

Now parameterize the 2nd bundle -- have the
first bundle feed it an argument, and have the
2nd bundle display that argument.


EXERCISE 

Sysadmin Problem:

/etc/profile should set the ORGANIZATION environment variable when users log in.

ORGANIZATION=MyOrg

Exercise:

Write a bundle "etc_profile_contains" that would take an argument
and ensures /etc/profile contains text string that specified
in the argument.

Demonstrate its use by calling it from another bundle:

    bundle agent example { 
       methods:  
         "any"
             usebundle => etc_profile_contains("export ORGANIZATION=MyOrg");
    }


EXERCISE  Methods (re-usable bundles)

Make a bundle called file_contains that takes two arguments:
a filename, and a text string.  The bundle should ensure that
the file specified in the first argument contains the text string
specified in the second argument.  Example:

    methods:
     "any" usebundle => file_contains("/etc/profile", "export ORGANIZATION=MyOrg");
     "any" usebundle => file_contains("/etc/motd", "Unauth. use forbidden");
