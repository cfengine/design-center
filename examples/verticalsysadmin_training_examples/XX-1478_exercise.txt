Set a custom class based on the existance of a file.
For example:

    classes:

       "file_exists"
         
           expression  =>  fileexists("/etc/site_id") ;

Then write another promise that is conditional on the 
above class.

Run it when the file exists, and when it does not, and
observe how CFEngine dynamically configures your server.
