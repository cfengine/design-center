promises.cf
1. comment out line 49, "$(sys.policy_hub)/16"
   in the definition of the "acl" variable
2. add your client and master IP addresses
   to the definition of the "acl" variable
3. change "twin" to "agent" in promises.cf
   in exec_command in "body executor control"

failsafe.cf
1. remove lines 107 - 116  (cf_promises_validated)
2. remove "      file_select  => u_input_files, "
   line from files: type promise on the inputs directory
   so that your template files (*.tmpl) get copied
   over as well.
3. change $(sys.policy_hub) to your server's IP address

ALWAYS edit your config files in master:/var/cfengine/masterfiles
NEVER edit directly in /var/cfengine/inputs anywhere (or it can
get overwritten).

Policy Flow 
from  policy_server:/var/cfengine/masterfiles/
to    end_node:/var/cfengine/inputs/

Troubleshooting:
cf-agent -f failsafe.cf -v
cf-serverd -v
