Tools used in CFEngine inter-node communication:

* cf-serverd

Used to distribute files to clients requesting them and
to listen to network requests for re-running the local
cf-agent.  


* cf-key

Key generation tool – run once on every host to create
public/private key pairs for secure communication.


* cf-runagent

Remote run agent – used to execute cf-agent on a remote
machine.  cf-runagent does not keep any promises, but instead
is used to ask another machine to do so.
