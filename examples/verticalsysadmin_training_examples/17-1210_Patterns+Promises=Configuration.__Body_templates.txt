"A pattern is just a repeated structure. The benefit of seeing
patterns is economy: if you can see a pattern, you can take
out the commonality, abstract it, and talk about the pattern
instead of all the individual cases. This is a Knowledge
Management step."  cfengine.org

body templates are intended to aid in such abstraction
