                       EXERCISE

Purpose: practice editing file content using a template 
containing scalar variables.



1. Manually create a template containing:

Hello $(example.first_name),

  Please buy our product.

Love,
Company


2. Populate contents of /tmp/letter.txt
   using the above template and the variable
   "first_name" defined in a bundle "example".

Gotchas:

- Make sure your bundle name matches the bundle name
  in the variable in the template.

- Make sure your bundle defines the variable embedded
  in the template.

If you finish before rest of the group, finish studying 
the CFEngine Reference Manual chapters 1 -4, and if you
finish that, then study the Special Topic guide on Editing
File Content.
