                       EXERCISE


1. Run this command to create a template containing
   CFEngine scalar variables:

      echo 'Hello, $(example.myname).  The time is $(sys.date).' > /templates/hello.tmpl

2. Write a policy to populate contents of /tmp/example.txt
   using the template /templates/hello.tmpl. 

Notes:

a) Make sure your bundle defines the variable embedded in the
   template, and that your bundle name matches the bundle name
   embedded in the template.

b) Your policy should use an edit_lines bundle containing an
   insert_lines promise with the following attributes:

      insert_type => "file",
      expand_scalars => "true";


If you finish before rest of the group, finish studying 
the CFEngine Reference Manual chapters 1 -4, and if you
finish that, then study the Special Topic guide on Editing
File Content.
