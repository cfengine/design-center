bootstrap your second host to your hub:


0.  on the second host, Install CFEngine Enterprise RPM 

    wget https://cfengine-package-repos.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/Enterprise-3.7.1/agent/agent_rhel6_x86_64/cfengine-nova-3.7.1-1.x86_64.rpm

    rpm -ihv ./cfengine-nova-3.7*rpm

1. On the hub, add the IP address of your host
   to the "acl" list in /var/cfengine/masterfiles/controls/3.7/def.cf
   (you can uncomment one of the entries there and change the IP address)

2. run the update policy ON THE HUB

    cf-agent -IC -f update.cf

3. restart cf-serverd ON THE HUB to load the new acl list

    service cfengine3 restart

4. on the second host, bootstrap to the hub:

    cf-agent -B your.hub.ip.address
-----------

Exercise

1. create "motd" file in /var/cfengine/masterfiles on the hub

     (example: vi /etc/motd) 

2. create a policy on the second host that will copy that file to /etc/motd on the 2nd host

   you can use special variable $(sys.policy_hub) which holds the Hub IP address
