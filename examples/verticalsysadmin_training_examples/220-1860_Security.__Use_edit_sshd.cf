# an example of a methods bundle accessing an
# array from the parent bundle.
#
# Arrays are not a data type in CFEngine; they
# are a data structure.
#
# Arrays cannot be "passed" as variables to a
# bundle or body. They are only referred to in
# some functions that search for their members
# and extract things like indices and values.
#
# So what you CAN pass is the name of the array,
# complete with context.
