                       EXERCISE


(If you finish early, please study the Reference
Manual, chapters 1 - 4; then the special topic guide
on the Editing File Content)


Manually create a template.  Embed a variable into the template:

    echo 'Hello, $(mybundle.myname).  The time is $(sys.date).' > /tmp/file.tmpl

Now write a policy to populate contents of /tmp/file.txt
using this template file, /tmp/file.tmpl. 

Make sure your bundle defines the variable embedded in the
template, and that your bundle name matches the bundle name
embedded in the template.

Your policy should use an edit_lines bundle containing an
insert_lines promise with the following attributes:

      insert_type => "file",
      expand_scalars => "true";

If you finish before rest of the group, finish studying 
the CFEngine Reference Manual chapters 1 -4, and if you
finish that, then study the Special Topic guide on Editing
File Content.
