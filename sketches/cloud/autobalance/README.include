Imagine if a single file or web resource could signal your infrastructure to
grow or shrink?

This is exactly what Cloud::Autobalance can do for you.  Just give it a URL,
some threshold definitions, and options for the EC2, OpenStack, and VMWare
connecttivity.  It will take care of creating or destroying VM instances in any
of those three environments using the Cloud::Services::VMWare,
Cloud::Services::OpenStack, and Cloud::Services::AWS::EC2 sketches.
