# cloud_services - Manage cloud services

## AUTHORS

## PLATFORM

## ## EC2 and S3 platforms

Anything that supports the Perl CPAN modules `JSON::XS` and
`XML::Simple`.

You can try the programming_languages/cpanm sketch to install
`JSON::XS` and `XML::Simple`, which will automagically install all
their dependencies as well.

## ## OpenStack platform

Just curl (in /usr/bin/curl or /bin/curl) and the CPAN JSON::XS module
are required.

## ## VMware platform

Perl in /usr/bin/perl and the VMWare interface programs (`vifs` and
`vmware-cmd`) are required.  You also need a VMWare ESXi server.

See the VMWare website for documents related to ESXi/vSphere 5: http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-50/index.jsp

You can also register on that website to download free trial versions of ESXi/vSphere 5 and related software.

## DESCRIPTION

This sketch can manage cloud instances in a generic way.  Right now
EC2, OpenStack, and the VMWare ESXi server are supported.

It can also synchronize a directory with a S3 bucket.

You specify a few initialization parameters, and then simply say 
"I want to start N instances of class X" or "I want to stop all instances
of class Y".  The "stop" state simply sets N to 0.  An internal Perl
script will take the delta between the desired and the actual instance
count and run or terminate that many instances.

For S3, "start" means synchronize; "stop" means clear.

We treat cloud instances as services and accordingly use the
`services` promise type in the `cloud_services` bundle.

## ## Classes

## ## Variables

Please note that `params/demo.json` has all these parameters in one
place, and it's much more convenient to use JSON data to set these
parameters than manually passing them to the `cloud_services` bundle.

* `ec2`: an array with keys specific to the EC2 service.  Any keys
  will be passed to the shim script, but the ones it recognizes today
  are: `ami` (the EC2 AMI to use), `instance_type` (the EC2 instance
  type to use), `region` (the region for the instances, defaults to
  'us-east-1' if you use JSON parameters), `security_policy` (the
  security policy to use, you can try "default" to block all access
  but that will include SSH), `aws_access_key`, `aws_secret_key`, and
  `ssh_pub_key` (self-explanatory).

    "cloudtest_ec2[ami]"             string => "ami-b89842d1";
    "cloudtest_ec2[instance_type]"   string => "m1.small";
    "cloudtest_ec2[region]"          string => "us-east-1";
    "cloudtest_ec2[security_group]"  string => mygroup";
    "cloudtest_ec2[aws_access_key]"  string => "akey1";
    "cloudtest_ec2[aws_secret_key]"  string => "skey1";
    "cloudtest_ec2[ssh_pub_key]"     string => "/path/to/file";

* `s3`: TODO, see `params/demo.json` or `test.cf`

* `vcli`: an array with keys specific to the vcli (VMWare) service.
  You can use `datastore` to indicate the datastore location;
  `fullpath` for the vmfs path; `password` and `user` for
  authentication, and `esxi_server` for the ESXi server's address.
  These parameters are used by the `vifs` and `vmware-cmd` commands.
  Finally you need the `master_image` to know the image to clone, and
  a `child_prefix` to name the clones sequentially.
  `disable_ssl_verify` disables the SSL certificate verification and
  defaults to 0 (false) if you use JSON parameters.

    "cloudtest_vcli[datastore]"           string => "datastore1";
    "cloudtest_vcli[fullpath]"            string => "/vmfs/volumes/4fda02bc-744a4c6e-40f2-08002781db6f";
    "cloudtest_vcli[password]"            string => "cfengine";
    "cloudtest_vcli[user]"                string => "root";
    "cloudtest_vcli[esxi_server]"         string => "10.0.0.1";
    "cloudtest_vcli[master_image]"        string => "ubuntu-12.04-i386-master";
    "cloudtest_vcli[child_prefix]"        string => "ubuntu-12.04-i386-clone-";
    "cloudtest_vcli[disable_ssl_verify]"  string => "1";

* `openstack`: TODO, see `params/demo.json` or `test.cf`

* `install_cfengine`: set to 1 to install CFEngine in the EC2 instance
  or 0 not to.  The VMWare integration ignores this parameter.
  
* `stype`: either `vcli` or `ec2` or `openstack` or `s3`.

* `count`: number of instances to start.

* `class`: a class to set on the new instances.  The VMWare
  integration ignores this parameter.

* `state`: either `start` or `stop`.

* `prefix`: a unique prefix for each execution of `cloud_services`.

* `bundle_home`: the installation directory of the sketch.

## REQUIREMENTS

CFEngine::stdlib (the COPBL)

## SAMPLE USAGE

See `test.cf`.
