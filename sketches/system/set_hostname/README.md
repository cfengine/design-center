## DESCRIPTION
* cfdc_set_hostname - Make sure the hostname and domainname of the system are set
  properly. Different distributions do things differently, specifically this
  is useful to correct hostname setting on redhat style machines. Contrary to
  official redhat documentation HOSTNAME in /etc/sysconfig/network should not
  be set to the fqdn, it causes the hostname utility to return the fqdn
  in stead of the shorthostname when run without arguments.

## REQUIREMENTS
* CFEngine Community 3.4.0 or greater
* Standard Library

## SAMPLE USAGE
See `test.cf` and `params/example.json` for standalone and JSON-driven usage, respectively.
